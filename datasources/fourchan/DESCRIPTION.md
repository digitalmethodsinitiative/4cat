4chan data is scraped internally by 4CAT. Depending on the installation, earlier data may be imported from data dumps 
uploaded by the archive [4plebs](https://archive.4plebs.org) or other archives like archived.moe. Contact the 
administrators for details on this.

<code>Deleted posts</code> are determined by whether they disappeared from the index or thread chain before the thread 
was archived. Replies to a deleted OP are <strong>not</strong> marked as deleted.

Results are limited to 5 million items maximum. Note that large queries can take a long time to complete!

### Importing archived data
4CAT offers a range of import script with which 4chan archives can be imported in the tool (e.g. from other 4CAT 
instances, 4plebs, archived.moe, and other sources). These scripts can be found in the 
[helper-scripts](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/tree/master/helper-scripts) folder.
