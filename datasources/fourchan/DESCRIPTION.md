4chan data is scraped internally by 4CAT. Depending on the installation, earlier data may be imported from data dumps uploaded by the archive [4plebs](https://archive.4plebs.org) or other archives like archived.moe. Contact the administrators for details on this.

Results are limited to 5 million items maximum. Note that large queries can take a long time to complete!

### Importing archived data
4CAT offers a range of import script with which 4chan archives can be imported in the tool (e.g. from other 4CAT instances, 4plebs, archived.moe, and other sources). These scripts can be found in the [helper-scripts](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/tree/master/helper-scripts) folder.
