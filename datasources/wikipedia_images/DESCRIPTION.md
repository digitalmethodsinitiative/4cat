Insert a full Wikipedia URL (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre) and the tool will retrieve all
language versions for the article. The tool will then scrape all the images of each language version and show them side
by side in a table for comparison. The images retain the order in which they appear in the page's source code (which 
usually, but not always, matches the order one would see them on the screen).
