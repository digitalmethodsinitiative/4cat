# 8kun data source for 4CAT

The 8kun data source works much the same as the 4chan data source. Please 
refer to the [installation instructions for local data sources](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/wiki/Enabling-local-data-sources) and `/datasources/fourchan/README.md` for more information.

This data source virtually identical to the 8chan data source. However,
since 8kun is distinct from 8chan and has a new owner, it serves as a 
separate data source to allow for changes to the platform without impacting
existing 8chan archives.
