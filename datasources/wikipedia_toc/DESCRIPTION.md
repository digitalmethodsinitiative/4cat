The tool allows one to enter a page title and language into the input field. The scraper will retrieve a list of all
revisions of the given page and language, taking into account page title normalization as well as possible redirects. By
default, a maximum of 50 TOC revisions will be retrieved.

Not all revisions may be retrievable, for example deleted revisions are
usually protected from public viewing on Wikipedia. Scraping large pages with many revisions may take a while. Wikipedia
needs to parse each individual revision to render the TOC, which is a more difficult task for larger pages.
