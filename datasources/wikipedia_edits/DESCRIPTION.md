This data source uses the Wikipedia API to scrape the complete edit history for a specific Wikipedia page. When 4CAT
finds an IP address instead of a user name it can use the
[Abstract API](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/ip-geolocation-api) to attempt to geolocate the IP address. Note that
this takes extra time and it is faster to not enable this option if you do not need the location
data.
