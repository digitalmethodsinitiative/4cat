This directory stores Session data for connection with APIs. Telegram
and Bluesky datasources use this for authentication.

This data contains information that, combined with with API ID and API hash 
(which are stored elsewhere, as temporary dataset metadata), can be used to interact 
with the APIs.

This is stored persistently so users do not need to authenticate with a
security code for each query, which is annoying and easily triggers
rate limiting.

TL;DR You can ignore this directory.
