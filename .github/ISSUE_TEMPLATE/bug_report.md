**4CAT Environment**
 - How are you accessing 4CAT? If possible, include the 4CAT web interface URL. Otherwise, explain if you are running 4CAT on your own device or accessing it remotely.
 - What version of 4CAT are you using? Find the version here:
   - In the latest versions of 4CAT, the version number is visible at the bottom of the interface
   - If you don't see the version there, that in itself is useful information
   - If you are using [Zeeschuimer](github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer), include its version number as well. Find it at the top of the interface.
 - If accessing via your own server/desktop, what is the environment (e.g. the operating system) and are you using Docker?
