"""
Script to import old 2006-2008 4chan/b/ threads from the Jason Scott archive.
This archive is downloadble here: https://archive.org/details/4chan_threads_archive_10_billion

Most of the data seems corrupted, but you can extract a few millions HTML files.
These will be converted into a 4CAT dataset with this script.

NOTE: The HTML files do not contain any time data or post IDs.
The thread IDs can be extracted from the file name. Therefore, this script interpolates the dates by using several known ID/time combinations for /b/. These data points are retrieved from Bibliotheca Anonoma's 4chan/History https://wiki.bibanon.org/4chan/History. See the dictionary below.
It also assigns post IDs by increasing the OP's ID with 1 for subsequent replies.
These are rough interpolations, not exact matches!

This script only works for the /b/ data in the archive; the date interpolation is based on activity on that board. 4CAT needs timestamps, so it will fail or assign wildly incorrect values for other boards.
