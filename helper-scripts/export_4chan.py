"""

This scripts converts the 4chan data from a 4CAT database
to be exported to a JSON or CSV file.

JSON dumps can be directly imported to Webjutter. 

It exports most data as-is, but also makes some changes.
- Thread data will not be stored in a different table, but as fields of an OP object.
- Deleted post data will be indicated by a 'deleted' field in a post object.
---- Posts in sticky threads will no longer be marked as deleted.
- The keys will be translated to reflect the 4chan API.
- Timestamp validity will be checked because data from the 4plebs dump features incorrect timezone data.
- Missed sticky posts will be marked as such. 
- Some posts that were incorrectly marked as deleted will be reverted and stored as undeleted.
- Homogenise the `author_type_id` so that variations like 'M' and 'mod' are the same.

- correct thread timestamps
- correct number of posts in threads
- correct number of images in threads
