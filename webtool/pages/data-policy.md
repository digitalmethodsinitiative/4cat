## Data Policy

When you use this 4CAT instance, we collect the following data:

- Your IP address and the URL through which you query our web tool will be 
  logged by our web server. This is required to monitor web server use, and 
  detect errors and abuse.

If you use the web interface to create datasets with 4CAT, we additionally 
save the following data:

- Any data provide as input for the 4CAT search tools. We need this to cache 
  results, perform your search queries more efficiently and reduce strain on 
  our server. This data is not linked to your IP address, but if it contains 
  personal information this will be saved on our server as part of the query 
  data. 
  
  Other users of 4CAT may see your dataset in the tool's interface. They will 
  not be able to see what account was used to create the dataset, only the  
  dataset itself.

If you access our web tool with a personal account, we additionally save the 
following data:

- Your e-mail address, which we use to identify you and to allow you to log in 
  to your personal account. We will not send you newsletters or other
  unsollicited e-mails, unless this is required to inform you of changes to
  this data policy or of incidents and major changes to the tool that might
  influence whether you want to continue using it.
  
- Any dataset you create will be linked to the account you are logged in 
  with. This makes it easier for you to revisit past datasets and access your 
  search results. We may also use this data to detect abuse and excessive usage 
  of our web tool. 
  
- When you mark a dataset as 'favourite', that information is stored on our
  servers, and may be viewed by 4CAT instance maintainers to monitor general 
  usage patterns. Regular users cannot see your favourites.
  
We do not share any of this data with anyone else. Anonymised data may be used 
as part of research projects. All data is stored on a secure server.

If you want to see or remove your personal data, please contact us at 
[%%ADMIN_EMAIL%%](mailto:%%ADMIN_EMAIL%%). Please allow some time for us to 
respond to you. We may ask you for further information to help us accurately 
respond to your request. 

Note that removal of personal data will usually involve removing your account, 
which will also limit your access to the 4CAT web tool.
