## Help & Bug Reports

4CAT is a tool with many features that is in active development, so inevitably sometimes you will run into bugs, or not
know what to do to get 4CAT to do what you want.

### Help!

A list of resources that can help you better understand 4CAT is collected on the 4CAT website, 
[4cat.nl](https://4cat.nl). You will find links to tutorial videos, exercises, worksheets and contact information there.

There is also a [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/discussions) page for 4CAT that is
actively monitored by its developers. Note that this is more suitable for technical questions and that for questions 
about e.g. coursework this is not the best place to ask &mdash; consult the resources linked on the website instead in 
that case, or contact your course instructor.

### Bugs and issues

If you find a bug in 4CAT (or if you suspect you found one), it is greatly appreciated if you report this to the 4CAT
developers so they are aware of it and have the opportunity to fix it in a future version. The preferred way to contact
the development team for this purpose is via 4CAT's [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/issues). You can see a list of known issues here
and add new ones via the 'New issue' button. If you're not sure your problem is worth creating an issue for, you can 
also open a [Discussion](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/discussions) about it.

You will need a GitHub account for this, but these are easy and free to create.
